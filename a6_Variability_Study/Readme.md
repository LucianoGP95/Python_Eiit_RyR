A small study to show the client how the variability when testing the same product in two nests is the result of non-controllable small variations and the testing machine is working as intended. The client takes the dataset by measuring the guides and each point of measure (fiber) is compared for both nests.

Methodology:
- Scatter plot plus linear regression: Visualizations of both the distribution and the tendency of each pair of fibers.
- Slope angle and specific differences: Tabulation of the slope of each linear regression pair to show if there is a decrease, increase and/or parallelism between fibers.
- Bland-Altman plots: Shows the difference versus mean for each pair of points. Is these values rtemain betwenn +-1.96 global standard deviations (95 % cumulated probability for a gaussian distribution) around the global mean for each pair of fibers its proven that the difference between each pair of values has a homogeneus behaviour.

Results:
The slope angle for all linear regressions is nearing 0 (10^-6). The differences of all pairs is neligible and the bland-altman plots shows pretty much all values inside the approval region. 

Conclussions: 
The machine works as intended and the variations are due to tolerances in the sensor-transductor equipment.
