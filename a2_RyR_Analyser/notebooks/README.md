Usage:
- globals.py controls the tooling variables. Write your tooling parameters here.
- a0_db: New data is imported to the database using this notebooks. It will get 
the data from a1_input/Target.xlsx and save it using the tooling name on globals.py
- a1_RyR_EDA: Used to visualize data and list the most problematic variables.
- a2_RyR_limits_generator: Dinamic generation of limits is done using , multiple formats to export.
- a3_RyR_filter: Filtering of outliers using z-score and creating a RyR.
- Some basic machine learning algorithms are applied to a4_RyR_classifier wihtout a particular goal outside of practicing ML.
