Usage:
- __globals support script controls the name of the tooling and other shared variables.
- Data is imported to the database using a0_db.
- Visualizations of the data focusing on the most problematic values are possible using a1_RyR_EDA.
- Dinamic generation of limits is done using a2_RyR_limits_generator, multiple formats to export.
- Filtering of outliers using z-score can be done in a3_RyR_filter.
- Some basic machine learning algorithms are applied to a4_RyR_classifier wihtout a particular goal outside of practicing ML.
